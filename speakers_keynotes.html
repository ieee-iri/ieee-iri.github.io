                        <p class="text-justify">
						Urban water systems are not self-contained units, economically or ecologically. They rely on larger biophysical supports from natural capital. 
						The behavior of such systems as a whole and the interactions between subcomponents can be observed. The optimization at system level to achieve 
						overall system efficiency will not only avoid burden shifting and inform more efficient subsystem design, but also provide sustainability and resiliency for the systems. 
						Complex, dynamic human-environment coupled water systems require a paradigm shift from the traditional "siloed" (drinking water, wastewater, stormwater etc.) management 
						approach and a move towards more holistic approaches to address the multiple issues facing municipal water systems. The concepts of fit-for-purpose, 
						resource recovery and decentralization to maximize resource use (energy, nutrients, materials, and water) have been considered to provide more sustainable solutions to 
						satisfy various water services. Here we present a design of an urban water system for cities of the future to emphasize how different water system services can be organized 
						in an organic entirety, and how such paradigm shift designs are substantially more efficient than existing centralized water systems. A unique thermodynamically-based accounting 
						tool and life cycle assessment are used to showcase the quantification of the energy distribution of the systems, and the associated environmental impacts and cost. 
						It provides in-depth analyses of the economic trade-offs, environmental impacts and system performances. The detailed holistic evaluation helps decision-makers design more robust, 
						effective and sustainable urban water systems.

						Predictive modeling with class-imbalanced data has proven to be a challenging task. This problem is well studied, but the era of big data is producing extreme levels of 
						imbalance that are increasingly difficult to model. In addition to the modeling challenges that are associated with these highly imbalanced data sets, we have found that 
						performance evaluation also requires careful considerations. In this talk, we demonstrate how the popular area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can provide 
						misleading results and recommend that any evaluation of imbalanced big data also includes the area under the precision-recall curve.

                        Guy Paillet started his career in 1994 at IBM France on mainframe programming. In 1998 he decided to switch toward microprocessors (Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800) which, 
						according to his boss at IBM when "Guy resigned", had no future... only mainframe will survive. In 1981, Guy founded DataSud Systems in France (with a branch in Phoenix AZ) 
						designing and manufacturing a wide catalog of VME boards. Under Guy's management as the CEO, DataSud grow to 100 persons, went public in 1986 and was acquired in 1988. 
						DataSud was among other products making one of the very first machine vision system in competition with Cognex USA. In 1989 Guy founded a new company Neuroptics in Montpellier (France) 
						which started applying software neural networks designed by Pr. Leon N. Cooper, Brown University (Physics Nobel Prize laureate) who started Nestor US (as Neuron Storage) in Providence RI. 
						Guy later teamed with IBM Labs in Paris and co-patented with IBM, the ZISC (Zero Instruction set architecture) mainly with Dr. Pascal Tannhof; five chips were designed on the ZISC model 
						from ZISC 36 (36 neurons) and ZISC 78 manufactured by IBM USA until 1996 -- the very first neural chip in the world in 1994. Guy moved to California bay and co-founded General Vision in 1999 with Anne Menendez. 
						General Vision's roadmap includes a patented Monolithic Image Perception Device (MIPD) which is planned for 2023 and will have image learning and recognition inside a 4 x 4 mm Image sensor with many applications 
						including biometrics, toys, pervasive suveillance and automotive. MIPD is planned to be commoditized in large volume.
