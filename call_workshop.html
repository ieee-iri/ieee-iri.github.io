                                Proposals are solicited for workshops to be held in conjunction with 27th IEEE
                                International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI 2026), July
                                31 - August 2, 2026, University of Washington Bothell, Seattle, WA, USA. In the current information-centric IT landscape, we live
                                in a data-driven era where effectively processing and integrating humongous volumes of
                                information from diverse sources in order to enable effective decision making and
                                knowledge generation has become one of the most significant challenges of current times.
                                The field of Information Reuse and Integration (IRI) seeks to maximize the reuse of
                                information by creating simple, rich, and reusable knowledge representations and
                                consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and
                                applications. IRI plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance,
                                integration, validation, and extrapolation of information; and applies both information
                                and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.

                                Each workshop will provide a forum to address a specific topic at the forefront of
                                information reuse and integration. A workshop must be a full or half-day in length. All
                                workshop papers will be included in the conference proceedings and on IEEE Xplore.
