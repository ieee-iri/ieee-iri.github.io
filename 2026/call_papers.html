                                The IRI conference showcases novel and contemporary research addressing all facets of
                                Data and Information Integration and Reuse in today's era of AI and Data Science –
                                including both Scientific Theory and Technology-based Applications. The
                                IEEE IRI conference and its workshops serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners
                                from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that
                                address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are
                                both welcome. The conference program will feature a regular research paper track, an
                                application/industry paper track, and a poster paper track, and include several plenary
                                speeches from academia, industry, and government as well as specialized workshops.
