                            Data science has become the new frontier for business analytics and AI. Such intelligent
                            applications derive from <em>Information Reuse and Integration</em> (IRI). IRI seeks to
                            maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge
                            representations. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this
                            knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capturing,
                            representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and
                            the knowledge derived from it. Additionally, IRI applies both information and knowledge for
                            enhancing
                            decision-making in various application domains.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            This conference explores three major tracks: <em>information reuse</em>,
                            <em>information integration</em>, and <em>reusable systems</em>. <em>Information reuse</em>
                            explores the theory and practice of optimizing representations; <em>information
                                integration</em>
                            focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel
                            domains; and <em>reusable systems</em> focus on developing and deploying models and
                            corresponding
                            processes that enable <em>Information Reuse</em> and <em>Integration</em>
                            to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application
                            domains.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia,
                            industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world
                            problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included.
                            The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and
                            keynote speeches. In recent years, the acceptance rate of IRI has been constantly <b>under
                                30%</b>,
                            maintaining the high quality standard and tradition of our conferernce.
