                                                <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                                                Enterprise networks are becoming increasingly complex,
                                                with applications living on hybrid clouds and network connectivity being provided by multiple mediums
                                                (wired, wireless, VPN, etc.) This complexity has made end-user experience visibility more important than ever.
                                                One very effective solution to the problem of end-user visibility is distributed network monitoring.
                                                In distributed network monitoring, multiple sensors are deployed within the network infrastructure to measure
                                                network and application performance and detect connectivity and performance degradation issues that
                                                could impact network users and critical applications.
                                                The performance data generated by the sensors is collected in a central repository for further processing and analysis.
                                                External systems like data analytics and software-defined network controllers stand to benefit from this data.
                                                Consequently, having application program interfaces (APIs) and integration with third party tools is very important.
                                                In this session, we will introduce a commercial distributed network monitoring solution called NetBeez,
                                                and show how NetBeez integrates with other tools like Splunk and Slack to enable network operators to be more proactive and
                                                effective in solving user-affecting network issues.
