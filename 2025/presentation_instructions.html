						<h4>This year IRI'2020 will be held virtually and we need you to prepare a video recording of your presentation and send a DOWNLOADABLE link to Dr. Chengcui Zhang (<a href="mailto:czhang02@uab.edu" >czhang02@uab.edu</a>) by <font color="red"><b>August 4th</b></font>. This is a hard deadline.</h4>
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						Full/Application/Workshop papers: ~18 minutes <br>
						Short papers: ~15 minutes <br>
						Posters and Demos: ~11 minutes <br>
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						Please note that this does <b>NOT</b> mean you don't need to attend the session and present your paper -- you are still expected to attend the assigned session, present your paper in a live remote mode, and answer questions from the session attendees. The video recordings will serve as a backup in case there is a bad internet connection.
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						Failure in effort to present the paper live will also be considered as a NO-SHOW and your paper will be withdrawn from the final conference proceedings.
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						Please note that the file must be a video file in MP4 format (more details below). Please do not try to upload PowerPoint or PDF files.

						<p class="text-justify">
						
						The recommended approach to record a compatible video from content displayed on your computer screen and voice recorded via the computer microphone, is to record the presentation using Zoom, available to users on most platforms and in most countries:
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						Instructions for recording your presentation with Zoom: <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/mobile/video/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom" target="_blank">https://ieeetv.ieee.org/mobile/video/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom</a>
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						For Authors located in China who are unable to access Zoom for free, use of the free software OBS, which allows also to capture simultaneously yourself while speaking and your slides: <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">https://obsproject.com/</a>
