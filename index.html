                            This year's conference is dedicated to the memory of <em><strong>Dr. Stuart Rubin</strong></em>, our Honorary General Chair.
                            Dr. Rubin was among the warmest of personalities, and had been with IRI since day one.
                            He will be missed, but not forgotten. We are currently planning for several events along with this year's IRI to honor Dr. Rubin. Please stay tuned.

                            Data science has become the new frontier for business analytics and AI. Such intelligent 
							applications derive from <em>Information Reuse and Integration</em> (IRI). IRI seeks to 
							maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge 
							representations. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this 
							knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capturing, 
							representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and 
							the knowledge derived from it. Additionally, IRI applies both information and knowledge for enhancing 
							decision-making in various application domains.
							
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            This conference explores three major tracks: <em>information reuse</em>, 
							<em>information integration</em>, and <em>reusable systems</em>. <em>Information reuse</em> 
							explores the theory and practice of optimizing representations; <em>information integration</em> 
							focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel 
							domains; and <em>reusable systems</em> focus on developing and deploying models and corresponding 
							processes that enable <em>Information Reuse</em> and <em>Integration</em> 
							to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, 
							industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world 
							problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. 
							The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and 
							keynote speeches. In recent years, the acceptance rate of IRI has been constantly <b>under 30%</b>, 
							maintaining the high quality standard and tradition of our conferernce.
