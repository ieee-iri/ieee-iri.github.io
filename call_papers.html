                                This year's conference is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Stuart Rubin, our Honorary
                                General Chair. Dr. Rubin was among the warmest of personalities, and had been with
                                IRI since day one. He will be missed, but not forgotten.

                                To honor Dr. Rubin, we organize a special track on "Symbolic AI and Heuristics for 
                                Data Science" during our conference. During the submission process, you can indicate 
                                if you would like to have your paper/poster considered for the special track. Judged 
                                by the PC members and co-chairs, accepted contributions to the "Symbolic AI and 
                                Heuristics for Data Science" theme will be organized in the special track at 
                                this year's IRI conference.

                                This conference presents excellent, novel, and contemporary papers covering all aspects
                                of Data - including Scientific Theory and Technology-Based Applications. The IEEE IRI
                                conference and its workshops serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners from
                                academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address
                                real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both
                                welcome. The conference program will include several plenary speeches from academia,
                                industry, and government as well as specialized workshops.
