							<h5><b>Why Stay at a Conference Hotel?</b></h5>
							<h5>You'll be in the center of conference activity. You'll be able to network easily with other conference attendees. You'll have a better conference experience overall. 
							But there are other reasons that you need to consider before you look at a hotel outside the official IEEE IRI 2024 room block.</h5>
							<h5>Situated in the heart of Silicon Valley, Sheraton San Jose is surrounded by the areaâ€™s top companies, attractions, shopping, and dining. 
							Accommodations are spacious with many amenities to enjoy. A full fitness center, a beautiful outdoor pool, and easy access to some of the best places to visit.</h5>
							<h5>The conference staff have diligently evaluated various locations to meet attendee and meeting space needs. Official conference hotels offer discounted rates based on a 
							guaranteed percentage of attendees. If this commitment isn't met, the hotel may charge for unfilled rooms, potentially increasing conference fees. Support the conference by 
							staying at the official hotel to enjoy networking opportunities, quality services, amenities, and convenient proximity to activities.</h5>

						<!--<h4>IRI 2023 will be an in-person conference, held on the UW Bothell campus from August 4 to August 6, 2023. Our objective is to create an interactive and engaging conference for all the presenters, authors, and 
						participants. We understand that some authors and presenters may not be able to travel to the conference site; however, we still anticipate a strong show of and from the remote participants. 
						We will share our presentation and participant guidelines later as a means to achieve our objective.</h4>-->
						
						<!--<p class="text-justify">
						
						To make the sessions more interactive and engaging, this year's IRI will involve the presenters, authors, and participants in a point-counterpoint exercise, so it is 
						important to attend and contribute to the entire session, facilitated by the session chair.
						
						<p class="text-justify">
						
						Failure in effort to present the paper live will also be considered as a NO-SHOW and your paper will be withdrawn from the final conference proceedings. Email Dr. Nan 
						Niu (<a href="mailto:nan.niu@uc.edu" >nan.niu@uc.edu</a>) if you have any questions about the conference program.-->
